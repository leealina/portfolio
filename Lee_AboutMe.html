                My name is Alina Lee and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School. 
                I was born in Dublin, California. I have one brother, Michael, who 
                goes to Cal Poly. Some of my hobbies are fencing, basketball, and 
                playing guitar and piano. 
                <br><br>
                My career goal is to be part of the movie industry, particularly
                animation, motion graphics, and graphic design. To achieve this, I plan to take 
                specific classes in high school and to look into internships that 
                relate to animation. I chose to pursue motion graphics because it
                is interesting to see how characters move just by programming.
                <br><br>
                Shown through sports and academics, I am ambitious because I strive
                to do better and to achieve my goals. I had to learn teamwork because 
                I played basketball in high school, which shows that I am cooperative.
                My creativity and artistic abilities are shown by the <a href="projects.html">
                projects</a> that I created for computer class. Outside of high school, 
                I fence in numerous national events and I am consistent in my results. 
                From my experiences in sports, I learned that I am capable of achieving
                success because of my persistence. From my work experiences, I learned to be 
                more open-minded and calmer than I was before. 
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, I hope all of my hard work pays off in the long run and I can
                get into a good college. Thank you for reading this far and please check
