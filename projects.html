                I made this project with Alan Liang using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/244532425/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>.
                We had to make a game with multiple levels that increased in difficulty.
                First, we brainstormed what games we wanted to try, like mazes,
                shell games, and platformers. Eventually, we narrowed it down to 
                the platformer because there were a lot of features that we could
                include in it. Then we started programming and made a rough
                draft of the game. The game was shared to another group in order to 
                get feedback on what we had to improve on. Alan and I fixed those
                problems and we created the game that you can play on the right
                (if flash doesn't work, click allow).
                <br><br>
                This platform game has four levels. The difficulty level increases
                when you pass a level. Use the arrow keys to move the player 
                (the blue block) around. The goal of the game is to touch the purple gem
                in order to get to the next level. There are also basic 
                instructions in the game. After you go through all of the levels, 
                there will be an option to play again. Time yourself using a watch 
                and see how fast you can complete all four levels.

                This app is a game that runs on Android devices. I made this project with Daylen Boen using 
                <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/#" target="_blank">MIT App Inventor</a>.
                We used the Get the Gold tutorial to have a starting point. The features
                in the game were not very user friendly and the game itself was bland.
                Daylen and I brainstormed possible things that we could put into the game, like
                score and time. We programmed our beta version which had more features than 
                the original game, but still wasn't finished. Eventually, we added 
                the two player mode so people could play together. The controls of the 
                game are a little laggy and buggy, but when we tried to fix it by having 
                button controls, MIT App Inventor did not support multi-touch. 
                <br><br>
                In this game, grab a friend and get ready to play. The brown ship is
                Player 1 and the green ship is Player 2. The object of the game is to 
                collect as many coins by swiping your ship in the direction that you want 
                to go in. When time runs out, the player with the most coins wins. Try
                to play at least three times and see who wins the most!

                I worked with Rhea to make a create-your-own-adventure using Python. There 
                were a lot of moving parts in this project because of the amount of different
                options there were to choose from. However, we made a flowchart which helped to 
                keep track of the different paths that could be taken. Using the flowchart, we were
                able to organize our code in order not to get confused. For each path, we created
                a new function so it would be easier to code. This allowed Rhea and I to come up
                with numerous ideas for what we wanted to implement in the adventure. 
                <br><br>
                The adventure takes place in a haunted house. The player has to overcome obstacles,
                like a ghost and a cat in order to complete their adventure successfully. There is
                only one winning path which makes this game difficult.

                Made with Python, this program goes through images to create unique pictures. My partner was 
                Trisha and we to created an image manipulation program. At first, we
                had a lot of ideas that we wanted to do, like adding customized text to the 
                images and a logo. However when we tried to implement it, the code kept 
                breaking. We researched how to fix the problem and we tried what was suggested
                online but it still did not work. This led us to only be able to keep the user
                input for the type and color of the border. 
                <br><br>
                Our image manipulation program has features where you can choose the 
                type and color of the border you want. The types of borders that are 
                available are the triangle (shown on the right), the rectangle, and the 
                star. There are a variety of different colors that can be chosen for the 
                border, such as neon green, blue, and purple (shown on the right). Another 
                feature is that you can add however many images you would like to modify and 
                they can be .jpg or .png. 
                <br><br>

                our program can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z9kB4RTS0QvEYRB2WkfYEN3ghIq8Sc5DdJx97uA019M/edit#slide=id.p" target="_blank">here</a>.
