                I made this project with Alan Liang using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/244532425/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>.
                We had to make a game with multiple levels that increased in difficulty.
                First, we brainstormed what games we wanted to try, like mazes,
                shell games, and platformers. Eventually, we narrowed it down to 
                the platformer because there were a lot of features that we could
                include in it. Then we started programming and made a rough
                draft of the game. The game was shared to another group in order to 
                get feedback on what we had to improve on. Alan and I fixed those
                problems and we created the game that you can play on the right.
                <br><br>
                This platform game has four levels. The difficulty level increases
                when you pass a level. Use the arrow keys to move the player 
                (the blue block) around. The goal of the game is to touch the purple gem
                in order to get to the next level. There are also basic 
                instructions in the game. After you go through all of the levels, 
                there will be an option to play again. Time yourself using a watch 
                and see how fast you can complete all four levels.

                This app is a game that runs on Android devices. I made this project with Daylen Boen using 
                <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/#" target="_blank">MIT App Inventor</a>.
                We used the Get the Gold tutorial to have a starting point. The features
                in the game were not very user friendly and the game itself was bland.
                Daylen and I brainstormed possible things that we could put into the game, like
                score and time. We programmed our beta version which had more features than 
                the original game, but still wasn't finished. Eventually, we added 
                the two player mode so people could play together. The controls of the 
                game are a little laggy and buggy, but when we tried to fix it by having 
                button controls, MIT App Inventor did not support multi-touch. 
                <br><br>
                In this game, grab a friend and get ready to play. The brown ship is
                Player 1 and the green ship is Player 2. The object of the game is to 
                collect as many coins by swiping your ship in the direction that you want 
                to go in. When time runs out, the player with the most coins wins. Try
                to play at least three times and see who wins the most!
