                I have volunteered at the Las Positas Fencing Center for about two years. I still volunteer 
                there on Tuesdays and Thursdays when I have time. I am an assistant coach and I help beginners
                to competitors to improve their skills in fencing. At the club, I also create activities and 
                drills to get the fencers into better shape. This volunteer experience is teaching me how to 
                be patient with people. Also, I learned how to be a leader but not intimidating people. 
                <br><br>
                When I have free time, I coach the fencers at local tournaments and I also get volunteer hours
                by doing this. I learned to keep my cool when they don't do things I tell them to do or when 
                they lose. Overall, volunteering at the Las Positas Fencing Center taught me a lot of things
                that I would have never learned without it.

                I worked at the AFM RYC as a referee. The Academy of Fencing Masters had a Regional Youth Circuit 
                tournament and I was hired to referee for two days. I refereed the foil and epee events because I 
                don't know how to ref saber. There were about 60 competitors in each event and I did parts of each 
                event. They paid $150 per day so in all, I got $300 for two days of work. 
                <br><br>
                This work experience taught me patience and how to deal with conflict. I had to be calm when coaches
                and fencers were yelling at me in order to avoid further problems. This was important because referees
                had to make the tournament run smoothly so it wouldn't get behind.
